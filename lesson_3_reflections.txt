When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    A remote repository will allow you to access your repository on other
    machines rather than the one with your original copy. This will also allow
    others to view your project and even contribute to it if the project is
    public.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It might make it easier to keep track (mentally) of your local directory if
    you pull manually. Having automatic pulls could also create conflicts in a
    live project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

    You would use forks when you want to make a copy of a repository on github.
    Making a copy from a local repo to a local repo would be a clone as well as
    copying a repo on Github to your local machine. A branch would be when you
    want to create a new feature or try to fix a big bug. The branches help
    keep the work separate so that it doesn't interfere with the running
    working project.
