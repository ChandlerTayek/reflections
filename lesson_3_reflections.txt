When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    A remote repository will allow you to access your repository on other
    machines rather than the one with your original copy. This will also allow
    others to view your project and even contribute to it if the project is
    public.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It might make it easier to keep track (mentally) of your local directory if
    you pull manually. Having automatic pulls could also create conflicts in a
    live project.
